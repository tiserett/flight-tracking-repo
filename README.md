# University project

That was my project for university when I was ending my 1st year of studying.
All the data is stored using binary search tree structure.

Below, you can see list of available functions.

Read data from .txt file.
Add flight to our structure.
Print all flights listed our structure.
Delete flight from our structure by it's number.
Get info about flight by it's number, and then delete it from our structure.

Everything is pretty simple, if you ever find it useful, feel free to use it all.
